# Base Template for Flask on Azure Websites
After several attempts to get a basic Flask app working on Azure. I discovered that you can deploy a Flask app (basic template) on Azure Websites. This template is what is deployed by Azure and I have copied here to utilize on future flask deployments. You can use at will, but Microsoft and Flask own the rights. I will only be trying to add documentation to make learning to deploye to Azure easier. 

Feel free to contribute.

# Future Items
- Document parts of template to help understand what is required and should be changed for "your app"
- Turn into a Cookie Cutter Template?
- What else?

Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. And before you ask: It's [BSD licensed](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/license/).
